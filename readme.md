## Installation
If you've already installed AutoHotKey, just open CoolLockTool.ahk with AutoHotkey.

## Executable
You can also use CoolLockTool.exe, which can work standalone w/o AutoHotKey.

# Usage
By default, `F8` initiates the script. If you have AutoHotkey installed, you can change this hotkey.

## Start with Windows
Standing in the directory that CoolLockTool lays in:

1. rightclick the .exe (or .ahk, if you would rather use that) file
2. `Create shortcut` and cut it
3. press `win + r` and write `shell:startup`
4. Paste the shortcut from before 
5. Reboot to confirm
