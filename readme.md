# Cool Lock tool
Cool Lock Tool does the following, when you press "F8"

* Takes a screenshot
* Sizes it down, and back up again for the pixelated effect
* Puts a lock on the image
* Sets the newly created image as your Lockscreen
* locks your computer


## Installation
If you've already installed AutoHotKey, just open CoolLockTool.ahk with AutoHotkey.

## Executable
You can also use CoolLockTool.exe, which can work standalone w/o AutoHotKey.

## Usage
By default, `F8` initiates the script. If you have AutoHotkey installed, you can change this hotkey.
To change the icon, put a file next to the script and call it "alock.png"

## Start with Windows
Standing in the directory that CoolLockTool lays in:

1. rightclick the .exe (or .ahk, if you would rather use that) file
2. `Create shortcut` and cut it
3. press `win + r` and write `shell:startup`
4. Paste the shortcut from before 
5. Reboot to confirm
